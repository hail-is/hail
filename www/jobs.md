The [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/about-us) was launched in 2004 to improve human health by using genomics to advance our understanding of the biology and treatment of human disease, and to help lay the groundwork for a new generation of therapies.

The Hail team's mission is to build tools to enable rapid analysis and exploration of massive genetic datasets (100s of TB and tripling yearly). We are committed to open science and everything we do is open source. We currently develop in Scala, Spark, Python and C/C++ but will use any tools we need to get the job done.

We’re looking for senior engineers with experience working on large, complex projects. You don’t need experience in biology or our particular technologies, but you must be excited to be challenged and learn new things. We work in a highly multi-disciplinary environment with biologists, bioinformaticians, doctors, mathematicians, and operations.

We're specifically seeking engineers to fill the following roles:

- Machine Learning engineer with experience in deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) and deep learning models. Experience in Bayesian methods or with RNAseq data analysis is a plus. Apply [here](https://broadinstitute.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/broad_institute/job/Cambridge-MA/Software-Engineer---Hail-Team_3168).
- Front-End software engineer with a focus on scientific data visualization. Experience with data science tools in Python or R and with JS visualization technologies like D3 is desired. Bonus if you know React, Redux, node and deployment tools (Docker, k8s). You will be the Hail team's first front-end person, and will have the opportunity to set the vision. Apply [here](https://broadinstitute.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/broad_institute/job/Cambridge-MA/Software-Engineer---Hail-Team_3168).
- Distributed Systems engineer who will help design the architecture to allow us to derive scientific insights from petabyte-scale datasets now and scale 3x/year for the foreseeable future. Apply [here](https://broadinstitute.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/broad_institute/job/Cambridge-MA/Software-Engineer---Hail-Team_3168).
- Engineer to support the Genome Aggregate Database (gnomAD) project. gnomAD is among the most comprehensive catalogues of human genetic variation in the world, and one of the largest genetic datasets. Analysis results are shared publicly and have had sweeping impact on biomedical research and the clinical diagnosis of genetic disorders. See [gnomad.broadinstitute.org](http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) for more info on gnomAD. Apply [here](https://broadinstitute.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/broad_institute/job/Cambridge-MA/Sr-Software-Engineer--Hail-Team_5596).
- Entry-level engineer to start in summer 2018. Apply [here](https://broadinstitute.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/broad_institute/job/Cambridge-MA/Associate-Software-Engineer-Hail_4830-1).

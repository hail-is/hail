**Genetic datasets** for disease [association studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study) now run in the terabytes, doubling every eight months. RNA-sequencing datasets measuring gene expression at single-cell resolution are at gigabyte-scale but doubling even faster in the quest for a [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.broadinstitute.org/research-highlights-human-cell-atlas). Much of this data comes from the [Broad Genomics Platform](https://www.broadinstitute.org/genomics), the largest producer of human genomics information in the world.

We believe there is a **unique opportunity** to transform the practice of computational biology by applying deep ideas from computer science and mathematics to build the next generation of modular, scalable tools for analyzing massive genetic and biological data. These tools will drive the development of new treatments and biotechnologies and fundamentally advance our understanding of life itself.

Two of us ([Cotton Seed](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/cotton-seed) and [Jon Bloom](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/jonathan-bloom)) co-founded the **Hail project** in the [Neale lab](http://www.nealelab.is/) of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/about-us) in Fall 2015 to help the genetics community [harness the flood of sequenced genomes](https://www.broadinstitute.org/blog/harnessing-flood-scaling-data-science-big-genomics-era) in order to unravel the genetic architecture of disease. Our open-source framework is already being used to analyze the largest genetic data sets in existence, to power dozens of major academic studies, and to meet the exploding needs of hospitals, diagnostic labs, and industry.

We are now building a new **Initiative in Scalable Analytics** in order to grow the Hail project within and beyond genetics and reduce the latency of computational experiments in biomedical research. And we are seeking **software engineers** at multiple levels of experience to join us!

Operationally, we're a **zero-equity start-up** embedded inside the world's leading biomedical and genomics research instutute, anchoring the [global heart of biotech](http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/06/19/boston-biotech-success) right across from MIT. We implement **distributed algorithms** on top of our custom-built language, compiler, and run-time system to support querying, aggregation, and linear algebra on hundreds of thousands of human genomes.

We thrive on **diverse challenges**: language and compiler design, low-level performance optimization, architecture of distributed systems, scaling of established methods and invention of new ones, visualization, interoperability with other powerful tools, and close collaboration with the amazing science and scientists all around us (this is super fun!). Our current **technology stack** includes the JVM, Scala, Spark, Python, GCP, and C++.

In addition to software development, our team is interested in the application of **machine learning** to problems in biology. We run the [Models, Inference and Algorithms Initiative](http://www.broadinstitute.org/mia) to foster community and pedagogy in greater Boston at the interface of computational biology, mathematical theory, and computer science.

# Updating third party images

This process updates third party images in cloud artifact registries after changes in [docker/third-party/images.txt](../../docker/third-party/images.txt) .

## Prerequisites

### Install skopeo

Not absolutely necessary but installing skopeo will make this go a lot smoother - and won't run into docker
"no space left on device" issues.

```bash
$ brew install skopeo
```

### Set the `kubectl` Context

Why do we need kubectl? Because this allows config.mk to access the global-config secret's .data.docker_prefix field. 

See [Setting the `kubectl` Context](setting_the_kubectl_context.md).

### Connect or fetch credentials to the container registry

Why? Because we need to push the third party images into the container registry.

See [Connecting Docker to Container Registry Credentials](connecting_docker_to_container_registry_creds.md).

 
## Run the following command to update the image:

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=default make -C  docker/third-party copy
```

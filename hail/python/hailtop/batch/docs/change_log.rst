Change Log
==========

**Version 0.2.66**

- Removed the need for the ``project`` argument in ``Batch()`` unless you are creating a PythonJob

**Version 0.2.65**

- Added ``PythonJob``
- Added new ``Job.memory`` inputs `lowmem`, `standard`, and `highmem` corresponding to ~1Gi/core, ~4Gi/core, and ~7Gi/core respectively.
- ``Job.storage`` is now interpreted as the desired extra storage mounted at `/io` in addition to the default root filesystem `/` when
  using the ServiceBackend. The root filesystem is allocated 5Gi for all jobs except 1.25Gi for 0.25 core jobs and 2.5Gi for 0.5 core jobs.
- Changed how we bill for storage when using the ServiceBackend by decoupling storage requests from CPU and memory requests.
- Added new worker types when using the ServiceBackend and automatically select the cheapest worker type based on a job's CPU and memory requests.

**Version 0.2.58**

- Added concatenate and plink_merge functions that use tree aggregation when merging.
- BatchPoolExecutor now raises an informative error message for a variety of "system" errors, such as missing container images.

**Version 0.2.56**

- Fix ``LocalBackend.run()`` succeeding when intermediate command fails

**Version 0.2.55**

- Attempts are now sorted by attempt time in the Batch Service UI.

**Version 0.2.53**

- Implement and document ``BatchPoolExecutor``.

**Version 0.2.50**

- Add ``requester_pays_project`` as a new parameter on batches.

**Version 0.2.43**

- Add support for a user-specified, at-most-once HTTP POST callback when a Batch completes.

**Version 0.2.42**

- Fixed the documentation for job memory and storage requests to have default units in bytes.

hailtop.batch Python API
========================

The Hail Batch Service is a multi-tenant elastic compute cluster for analyzing datasets in the cloud. It
is available in both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. At this time, the
Hail-maintained Batch Service is only available for users with a Broad Institute affiliation. However, there are
instructions available for how to deploy the Hail Batch Service in your own projects in our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/hail-is/hail>`__.
To learn more about the Hail Batch Service, take a look at our `documentation <https://hail.is/docs/batch/service.html>`__.

The Python library ``hailtop.batch`` is a client library for defining workflows for the Hail Batch Service to execute.
To learn more about the Python client library, there is a `tutorial <https://hail.is/docs/batch/tutorial.html>`__ and
`cookbooks <https://hail.is/docs/batch/cookbook.html>`__ with detailed examples. The API documentation is available `here <https://hail.is/docs/batch/api.html>`__.

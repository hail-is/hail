Libraries
===================

This pages lists any external libraries we are aware of that are built on top of Hail. These libraries are not developed by the Hail team so we cannot necessarily answer
questions about them, but they may provide useful functions not included in base Hail.

gnomad (Hail Utilities for gnomAD)
----------------------------------

This repo contains a number of Hail utility functions and scripts for the `gnomAD <https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org>`_ project and the `Translational Genomics Group <https://the-tgg.org/>`_.

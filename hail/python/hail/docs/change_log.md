# Change Log

## 0.2.21

Released 2019-09-03

### Bug fixes
- (hail#6945) Fix `expand_types` to preserve ordering by key, also affects
    `to_pandas` and `to_spark`.
- (hail#6958) Fix stack overflow errors when counting the result of a `Table.union`.

### New features
- (hail#6856) Teach `hl.agg.counter` to weigh each value differently.
- (hail#6903) Teach `hl.range` to treat a single argument as `0..N`.
- (hail#6903) Teach `BlockMatrix` how to `checkpoint`.

### Performance
- (hail#6895) Improve performance of `hl.import_bgen(...).count()`.
- (hail#6948) Fix performance bug in `BlockMatrix` filtering functions.
- (hail#6943) Improve scaling of `Table.union`.
- (hail#6980) Reduce compute time for `split_multi_hts` by as much as 40%.

### `hailctl dataproc`
- (hail#6904) Add `--dry-run` option to `submit`.

---

## 0.2.20

Released 2019-08-19

### Critical memory management fix

- (hail#6824) Fixed memory management inside `annotate_cols` with
  aggregations. This was causing memory leaks and segfaults.

### Bug fixes
- (hail#6769) Fix non-functional `hl.lambda_gc` method.
- (hail#6847) Fix bug in handling of NaN in `hl.agg.min` and `hl.agg.max`.
  These will now properly ignore NaN (the intended semantics). Note that
  `hl.min` and `hl.max` propagate NaN; use `hl.nanmin` and  `hl.nanmax`
  to ignore NaN.

### New features
- (hail#6847) Added `hl.nanmin` and `hl.nanmax` functions. 

-----

## 0.2.19

Released 2019-08-01

### Critical performance bug fix

- (hail#6629) Fixed a critical performance bug introduced in (hail#6266).
  This bug led to long hang times when reading in Hail tables and matrix
  tables **written in version 0.2.18**.

### Bug fixes
- (hail#6757) Fixed correctness bug in optimizations applied to the
  combination of `Table.order_by` with `hl.desc` arguments and `show()`,
  leading to tables sorted in ascending, not descending order.
- (hail#6770) Fixed assertion error caused by `Table.expand_types()`,
  which was used by `Table.to_spark` and `Table.to_pandas`. 

### Performance Improvements

- (hail#6666) Slightly improve performance of `hl.pca` and 
  `hl.hwe_normalized_pca`.
- (hail#6669) Improve performance of `hl.split_multi` and 
  `hl.split_multi_hts`.
- (hail#6644) Optimize core code generation primitives, leading to
  across-the-board performance improvements.
- (hail#6775) Fixed a major performance problem related to reading block 
  matrices.
  
### `hailctl dataproc`

- (hail#6760) Fixed the address pointed at by `ui`  in `connect`, after
  Google changed proxy settings that rendered the UI URL incorrect. Also
  added new address `hist/spark-history`.

-----

## 0.2.18

Released 2019-07-12
    
### Critical performance bug fix

- (hail#6605) Resolved code generation issue leading a performance 
  regression of 1-3 orders of magnitude in Hail pipelines using
  constant strings or literals. This includes almost every pipeline!
  **This issue has exists in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.2.17, and
  any users on those versions should update as soon as possible.**
  
### Bug fixes

- (hail#6598) Fixed code generated by `MatrixTable.unfilter_entries` to
  improve performance. This will slightly improve the performance of
  `hwe_normalized_pca` and relatedness computation methods, which use
  `unfilter_entries` internally.

-----

## 0.2.17

Released 2019-07-10

### New features

- (hail#6349) Added `compression` parameter to `export_block_matrices`, which can
  be `'gz'` or `'bgz'`.
- (hail#6405) When a matrix table has string column-keys, `matrixtable.show` uses
  the column key as the column name.
- (hail#6345) Added an improved scan implementation, which reduces the memory
  load on master.
- (hail#6462) Added `export_bgen` method.
- (hail#6473) Improved performance of `hl.agg.array_sum` by about 50%.
- (hail#6498) Added method `hl.lambda_gc` to calculate the genomic control inflation factor.
- (hail#6456) Dramatically improved performance of pipelines containing long chains of calls to
  `Table.annotate`, or `MatrixTable` equivalents.
- (hail#6506) Improved the performance of the generated code for the `Table.annotate(**thing)`
  pattern.

### Bug fixes

- (hail#6404) `n_rows` and `n_cols` parameters added to `Expression.show` for
  consistency with other `show` methods.
- (hail#6408)(hail#6419) Fixed an issue where the `filter_intervals` optimization
  could make scans return incorrect results.
- (hail#6459)(hail#6458) Fixed rare correctness bug in the `filter_intervals`
  optimization which could result too many rows being kept.
- (hail#6496) Fixed html output of `show` methods to truncate long field
  contents.

  and `approx_quantiles` aggregators.
- (hail#6504) Fix `Table.show` collecting data twice while running in Jupyter notebooks.

- (hail#6583) Fixed `hl.plot.manhattan` for non-default reference genomes.

### Experimental

- (hail#6488) Exposed `table.multi_way_zip_join`. This takes a list of tables of
  identical types, and zips them together into one table.

-----

## 0.2.16

Released 2019-06-19

### `hailctl`

- (hail#6357) Accommodated Google Dataproc bug causing cluster creation failures. 
 
### Bug fixes

- (hail#6378) Fixed problem in how `entry_float_type` was being handled in `import_vcf`.

-----

## 0.2.15

Released 2019-06-14

After some infrastructural changes to our development process, we should be
getting back to frequent releases.

### `hailctl`

Starting in 0.2.15, `pip` installations of Hail come bundled with a command-
line tool, `hailctl`. This tool subsumes the functionality of `cloudtools`,
which is now deprecated. See the 
[release thread on the forum](https://discuss.hail.is/t/new-command-line-utility-hailctl/981)
for more information.

### New features

- (hail#5932)(hail#6115) `hl.import_bed` abd `hl.import_locus_intervals` now
  accept keyword arguments to pass through to `hl.import_table`, which is used
  internally. This permits parameters like `min_partitions` to be set.
- (hail#5980) Added `log` option to `hl.plot.histogram2d`.
- (hail#5937) Added `all_matches` parameter to `Table.index` and
  `MatrixTable.index_{rows, cols, entries}`, which produces an array of all
  rows in the indexed object matching the index key. This makes it possible to,
  for example, annotate all intervals overlapping a locus.
- (hail#5913) Added functionality that makes arrays of structs easier to work
  with.
- (hail#6089) Added HTML output to `Expression.show` when running in a notebook.
- (hail#6172) `hl.split_multi_hts` now uses the original `GQ` value if the `PL`
  is missing.
- (hail#6123) Added `hl.binary_search` to search sorted numeric arrays.
- (hail#6224) Moved implementation of `hl.concordance` from backend to Python.
  Performance directly from `read()` is slightly worse, but inside larger
  pipelines this function will be optimized much better than before, and it
  will benefit improvements to general infrastructure.
- (hail#6214) Updated Hail Python dependencies.
- (hail#5979) Added optimizer pass to rewrite filter expressions on keys as
  interval filters where possible, leading to massive speedups for point queries.
  See the [blog post](https://discuss.hail.is/t/new-optimizer-pass-that-extracts-point-queries-and-interval-filters/979)
  for examples.

### Bug fixes

- (hail#5895) Fixed crash caused by `-0.0` floating-point values in `hl.agg.hist`.
- (hail#6013) Turned off feature in HTSJDK that caused crashes in `hl.import_vcf`
  due to header fields being overwritten with different types, if the field had
  a different type than the type in the VCF 4.2 spec.
- (hail#6117) Fixed problem causing `Table.flatten()` to be quadratic in the size
  of the schema.
- (hail#6228)(hail#5993) Fixed `MatrixTable.union_rows()` to join distinct keys
  on the right, preventing an unintentional cartesian product.
- (hail#6235) Fixed an issue related to aggregation inside `MatrixTable.filter_cols`.
- (hail#6226) Restored lost behavior where `Table.show(x < 0)` shows the entire table.
- (hail#6267) Fixed cryptic crashes related to `hl.split_multi` and `MatrixTable.entries()`
  with duplicate row keys.

-----

## 0.2.14

Released 2019-04-24

A back-incompatible patch update to PySpark, 2.4.2, has broken fresh pip
installs of Hail 0.2.13. To fix this, either *downgrade* PySpark to 2.4.1 or
upgrade to the latest version of Hail.

### New features

- (hail#5915) Added `hl.cite_hail` and `hl.cite_hail_bibtex` functions to

-----

## 0.2.13

  unicode characters.
- (hail#5692) When `keyed` is `True`, `hl.maximal_independent_set` now does not
  produce duplicates.
- (hail#5725) Docs now consistently refer to `hl.agg` not `agg`.
- (hail#5730)(hail#5782) Taught `import_bgen` to optimize its `variants` argument.

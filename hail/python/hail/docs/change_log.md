# Change Log

## Frequently Asked Questions

### With a version like 0.x, is Hail ready for use in publications?

Yes. The [semantic versioning standard](https://semver.org) uses 0.x (development) versions to
refer to software that is either "buggy" or "partial". While we don't view
Hail as particularly buggy (especially compared to one-off untested
scripts pervasive in bioinformatics!), Hail 0.2 is a partial realization
of a larger vision.

### What stability is guaranteed?

We do not intentionally break back-compatibility of interfaces or file
formats. This means that a script developed to run on Hail 0.2.5 should
continue to work in every subsequent release within the 0.2 major version.
**The exception to this rule is experimental functionality, denoted as
such in the reference documentation, which may change at any time**.

Please note that **forward compatibility should not be expected, especially
relating to file formats**: this means that it may not be possible to use
an earlier version of Hail to read files written in a later version.

- (hail#6496) Fixed html output of `show` methods to truncate long field
  contents.
- (hail#6478) Fixed the broken documentation for the experimental `approx_cdf`
  and `approx_quantiles` aggregators.
- (hail#6504) Fix `Table.show` collecting data twice while running in Jupyter notebooks.

-----

## Version 0.2.16

Released 2019-06-19

### `hailctl`

- (hail#6357) Accommodated Google Dataproc bug causing cluster creation failures.

### Bug fixes

- (hail#6378) Fixed problem in how `entry_float_type` was being handled in `import_vcf`.

-----

## Version 0.2.15

Released 2019-06-14

After some infrastructural changes to our development process, we should be
getting back to frequent releases.

### `hailctl`

Starting in 0.2.15, `pip` installations of Hail come bundled with a command-
line tool, `hailctl`. This tool subsumes the functionality of `cloudtools`,
which is now deprecated. See the
[release thread on the forum](https://discuss.hail.is/t/new-command-line-utility-hailctl/981)
for more information.

### New features

- (hail#5932)(hail#6115) `hl.import_bed` abd `hl.import_locus_intervals` now
  accept keyword arguments to pass through to `hl.import_table`, which is used
  internally. This permits parameters like `min_partitions` to be set.
- (hail#5980) Added `log` option to `hl.plot.histogram2d`.
- (hail#5937) Added `all_matches` parameter to `Table.index` and
  `MatrixTable.index_{rows, cols, entries}`, which produces an array of all
  rows in the indexed object matching the index key. This makes it possible to,
  for example, annotate all intervals overlapping a locus.
- (hail#5913) Added functionality that makes arrays of structs easier to work
  with.
- (hail#6089) Added HTML output to `Expression.show` when running in a notebook.
- (hail#6172) `hl.split_multi_hts` now uses the original `GQ` value if the `PL`
  is missing.
- (hail#6123) Added `hl.binary_search` to search sorted numeric arrays.
- (hail#6224) Moved implementation of `hl.concordance` from backend to Python.
  Performance directly from `read()` is slightly worse, but inside larger
  pipelines this function will be optimized much better than before, and it
  will benefit improvements to general infrastructure.
- (hail#6214) Updated Hail Python dependencies.
- (hail#5979) Added optimizer pass to rewrite filter expressions on keys as
  interval filters where possible, leading to massive speedups for point queries.
  See the [blog post](https://discuss.hail.is/t/new-optimizer-pass-that-extracts-point-queries-and-interval-filters/979)
  for examples.

### Bug fixes

- (hail#5895) Fixed crash caused by `-0.0` floating-point values in `hl.agg.hist`.
- (hail#6013) Turned off feature in HTSJDK that caused crashes in `hl.import_vcf`
  due to header fields being overwritten with different types, if the field had
  a different type than the type in the VCF 4.2 spec.
- (hail#6117) Fixed problem causing `Table.flatten()` to be quadratic in the size
  of the schema.
- (hail#6228)(hail#5993) Fixed `MatrixTable.union_rows()` to join distinct keys
  on the right, preventing an unintentional cartesian product.
- (hail#6235) Fixed an issue related to aggregation inside `MatrixTable.filter_cols`.
- (hail#6226) Restored lost behavior where `Table.show(x < 0)` shows the entire table.
- (hail#6267) Fixed cryptic crashes related to `hl.split_multi` and `MatrixTable.entries()`
  with duplicate row keys.

-----

## Version 0.2.14

Released 2019-04-24

A back-incompatible patch update to PySpark, 2.4.2, has broken fresh pip
installs of Hail 0.2.13. To fix this, either *downgrade* PySpark to 2.4.1 or

  unicode characters.
- (hail#5692) When `keyed` is `True`, `hl.maximal_independent_set` now does not
  produce duplicates.
- (hail#5725) Docs now consistently refer to `hl.agg` not `agg`.
- (hail#5730)(hail#5782) Taught `import_bgen` to optimize its `variants` argument.

  of the quantiles of an expression.

Hail does not have any built-in tools for working with `Amazon EMR
<https://aws.amazon.com/emr/>`__.

If you'd like to deploy Hail on AWS, we recommend that you try the `open-source Cloudformation tool <https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances>`__ maintained by the `Avillach Lab <https://avillach-lab.hms.harvard.edu/>`_ at Harvard Medical School.

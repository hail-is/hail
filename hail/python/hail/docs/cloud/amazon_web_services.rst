While Hail does not have any built-in tools for working with `Amazon EMR
<https://aws.amazon.com/emr/>`__, there are two approaches maintained by third parties:

1. AWS maintains a `Hail on AWS quickstart <https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/hail/>`__.
2. The `Avillach Lab <https://avillach-lab.hms.harvard.edu/>`_ at Harvard Medical School maintains an `open-source tool <https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances>`__.
